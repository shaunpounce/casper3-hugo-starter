# Once upon a time there was a coder...

 I will go back to Gotham and I will fight men like this but I will not become an executioner. Bats frighten me. It's time my enemies shared my dread.

 I can't do that as Bruce Wayne... as a man. I'm flesh and blood. I can be ignored, destroyed. But as a symbol, I can be incorruptible, I can be everlasting. Someone like you. Someone who'll rattle the cages.

 This isn't a car. This isn't a car. It's not who I am underneath but what I do that defines me. I'm Batman Bats frighten me. It's time my enemies shared my dread. The first time I stole so that I wouldn't starve, yes. I lost many assumptions about the simple nature of right and wrong. And when I traveled I learned the fear before a crime and the thrill of success. But I never became one of them.

 Does it come in black? This isn't a car. Swear to me! Swear to me! My anger outweights my guilt. The first time I stole so that I wouldn't starve, yes. I lost many assumptions about the simple nature of right and wrong. And when I traveled I learned the fear before a crime and the thrill of success. But I never became one of them.
